TriFA
=====

Package with methods for computing background quantities and scale-dependent
growth factors for massive neutrino cosmologies using a 3-fluid approximation,
following Zennaro+16. Supports multi-fluid models with distinct transfer
functions and interfaces with classy.

Quick Starting Guide
--------------------

First build the C library with

``
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
``

Then the python package can be loaded with

``
import trifa
``

Requirements
------------
+ GSL
+ CLASS / classy (optional)

Example
-------

The following snippet computes the present-day mass fraction of
non-relativistic neutrinos for a given cosmological model.

``
from trifa import *

# The neutrino species
M_nu = [0.05, 0.1] # eV
deg_nu = [1.0, 2.0] # degeneracies
N_nu = len(M_nu)

# Initialise a unit system (default uses Mpc and km/s velocities)
unit_system, physical_consts = units.init_units()

# We want to integrate the cosmological tables from this point
a_start = 1e-3

# Set up a cosmological model
params = {"h": 0.67,
          "Omega_b": 0.048,
          "Omega_c": 0.242,
          "N_nu": N_nu,
          "M_nu": M_nu,
          "deg_nu": deg_nu,
          "T_nu_0": 1.95,
          "T_CMB_0": 2.728,
          "w0": -1.0}
model = cosmology.MODEL()
model.set(params)
model.compute(unit_system, physical_consts, a_start)

f_nu = model.get_f_nu_nr_tot_of_a(1.0)
print("The neutrino fraction is:", f_nu)
``

See example.py for an a calculation of growth factors using growth rates
from classy.
